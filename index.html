<!-- Theory Questions: 

1. Emmet : 
Emmet uses different abbreviations and short expressions depending on what's passed, and then dynamically converts the abbreviations into the full code. Emmet is mostly used for HTML, XML, and CSS, but it can also be used with programming languages
Example : 
ul>li*3 abbreviated as: 
<ul>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
</ul> 

2.Difference between a library and framework: 
The framework provides the flow of a software application and tells the developer what it needs and calls the code provided by the developer as required. If a library is used, the application calls the code from the library

3. What is a CDN Link 
A content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content.
 
4. What is crossorigin in script tag? 

The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request.
Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where CORS comes in.
A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.
CORS is used to manage cross-origin requests.
CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, and is a mechanism that allows resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside their own domain. It defines a way of how a browser and server can interact to determine whether it is safe to allow the cross-origin request. CORS allows servers to specify who can access the assets on the server, among many other things.

5. Why react is known as React ? 
React is named React because of its ability to react to changes in data. When the data in a React component changes, React will automatically re-render the component so that it reflects the new data. This makes it easy to create performant user interfaces that always look up-to-date.

6. What is difference between react.development.js and react.production js files via CDN?.
The **react.development.js** file is a version of the React library that is optimized for development. It includes extra warnings and error messages that can help you find problems with your code, and it is generally larger in size than the production version of the library.
On the other hand, the **react.production.js** file is a version of the React library that is optimized for production. It has been **minified** and stripped of **unnecessary code**, so it is **smaller in size** and runs more **efficiently** in the browser. It does not include the extra warnings and error messages that are present in the development version of the library.

8. React and React DOM 
In short, **React** is a library for building UI components, and **ReactDOM** is a library that is use to render those components to the **DOM**. They are commonly used together, but they are distinct libraries with different functions.
**ReactDOM** is responsible for updating the DOM to reflect the changes made to a React Component.
